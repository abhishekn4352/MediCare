## Technologies Used

- **React** - Component-based UI library
- **Vite** - Fast build tool and development server
- **CSS3** - Responsive layouts with Grid and Flexbox
- **JavaScript ES6+** - Modern JavaScript features

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation Steps

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Open in browser**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (default Vite port)

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

Output files will be in the `dist/` folder.

## Key Components

### Dashboard
- Displays key statistics (Total Patients, Appointments, Doctors, Emergency Cases)
- Shows recent activity feed
- Quick action buttons for common tasks

### Patient List
- Filterable table of patient records
- Search by name or ID

## Features Implementation

### State Management
- Uses React hooks (`useState`) for component-level state management
- Efficient re-rendering with proper dependency management

### Responsive Design
- **Mobile** (< 480px) - Single column layout, vertical navigation
- **Tablet** (480px - 768px) - Optimized grid layouts
- **Desktop** (> 768px) - Multi-column layouts with full functionality

### UI/UX Principles

- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

## Performance Optimizations

- Component-based architecture for code reusability
- CSS modules to prevent style conflicts
- Optimized animations using CSS transforms
- Lazy component loading ready for future expansion

## Future Enhancements

- Backend API integration
- Authentication and authorization
- Data persistence with database
- Advanced filtering and sorting
- Export functionality (PDF, CSV)
- Real-time notifications
- Dark mode toggle
- Role-based access control
